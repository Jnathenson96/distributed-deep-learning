Fair warning that pretty much every step here took a lot of haggling for me to figure out, so there is a chance it will not work on the first try. Contact me and I _might_ have insight.

1. Use the instructions on the tvm repository at apps/android_deploy to compile the demo android app. YOU MUST USE JAVA 8 for this step or it will not wwork. You should be able to run the demo app after this (otherwise contact me with problems)

2. Comment out the line in android_deploy/app/build.gradle that applies the download-assets plugin. The line is 'apply from: "download-models.gradle"'

3. Generate the cross compilier using the android-ndk. A line that works for this is on the android_deploy README under cross compile and run on android devices (using the android-ndk make-standalone-toolchain.sh)

4. In deploy_model_on_android.py there is a hard-coded path to cc="..." That is the path that I installed the tools on my system. Change that to match the path on your system.

5. run deploy_model_on_android.py. Ignore some of the comments in that script because it was modified from a script to generate models for the raspberry pi. It will generate models in a directory ./tmp/. Copy everything in that directory to tvm/apps/android_deploy/app/src/main/assets . You must keep in that directory the imagenet.shortnames.list

in tvm/apps/android_deploy/app/src/main/jni there is a file Application.mk. You must modify in that file the line "APP_STL:=..." to "APP_STL := c++_shared"

use "gradle clean build" to build the apk. Hopefully it works.
